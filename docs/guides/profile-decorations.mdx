# Profile Decorations
Those silly things that go over your profile picture? Yeah, that's here.

### Requirements

* Follow the [guidelines](/docs/guides/)
* The media type has to be a PNG or APNG for animated decorations
* The dimensions of the image have to be 250x250 (pixels)
* The contents on the image have to be clearly readable or visible
* The user's profile picture must be reasonably visible
* If making animated Profile Picture, the maximum length is 30 seconds or 5MB

### Instructions

We have prepared both an image and a Photoshop file to help you with creating a proper Profile Decoration. You can choose either.

There are 2 circles:

* **The inner, lighter** circle indicates the part of the decoration that will be **overlaying** the user's profile picture
* **The outer, darker** circle indicates the zone outside of the user's profile picture, you can go wild there. It also has the exact same color as the Nightlight's background, meaning that you can use it to help make the visibility and readability better.&#x20;

You can use the entirety of the 250x250 space, but please try to leave some space on the edges.
