You can modify any of the HEX colors there and your changes will appear in real time on Nightlight. **Keep in mind that refreshing the page will reset the modified values.**

3. After you're happy with your result, you can replace the values in the template file with your custom HEX colors, just like you did in the browser.
4. Save and you're ready for submitting!
