Style Nightlight to your likings! Yum

### Requirements

* Follow the [guidelines](/docs/guides/guidelines)
* The file has to be a JSON and follow the Nightlight Theme Template
* All text on Nightlight has to be properly readable while the theme is applied

### Instructions

1. Download the attached file below, which contains the default theme values for Nightlight

          [Download the theme template file (.json)](./assets/nightlight-theme-template.json)

2. Try out different colors on Nightlight using Developer Tools in your favorite browser.

In the Inspect tab,  you should see this:

![example image](/wiki-files/themes/themes.avif) 

You can modify any of the HEX colors there and your changes will appear in real time on Nightlight. **Keep in mind that refreshing the page will reset the modified values.**

3. After you're happy with your result, you can replace the values in the template file with your custom HEX colors, just like you did in the browser.
4. Save and you're ready for submitting!
