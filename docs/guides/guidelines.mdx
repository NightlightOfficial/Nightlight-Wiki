# Guidelines
The general rules you have to follow before submitting your item. Please make sure to read them thoroughly and follow them.

### Content you can't share

You are not allowed to submit items:

* Content you do not own or are not permitted to submit by the author. This includes Copyright-protected content.
* NSFW: Nudity, sexually explicit, harassing or illegal content
* You can post light profanity, but make sure to censor them using asterisks or other means, for example: Sh\*t
* AI-generated content
* Duplicate content. If someone published it already, don't share it again.&#x20;

:::note

If you are unsure, you can contact us on Nightlight by messaging us.

### How we manage your content

* We set the price and rarity, it can't be too cheap but also can't be too expensive either.
* You will get half of the item's value whenever someone purchases it AND 1/5 of required XP for level-up!
