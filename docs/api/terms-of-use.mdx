# API Terms of Use

### **API Terms of Use**

1. Free for non-commercial use.
2. Using the NLAPI as a backup or data storage service is strictly prohibited.&#x20;
3. ‘Hoarding’ or mass collection of data from the NLAPI is strictly prohibited.&#x20;
4. Applications or services must comply with our naming guidelines.

### Naming Guidelines

Applications or services that utilize the NLAPI must adhere to our naming guidelines:

* If “Nightlight” or “NLAPI” are used in the title/name of the application you must clearly state your app is an unofficial app by appending either “UNOFFICIAL” or “for Nightlight”/”for NLAPI” to the title/name of the application.
* Just the titles/names “Nightlight” or “NLAPI” are strictly prohibited.

### **Request API use for commercial clients**

If you would like to use the NLAPI in a commercial client (this includes ads or in-app purchases), contact us at support@nightlightapp.net. With the current usage of the API, it is rather unlikely that any kind of profit cut etc. will be necessary.
