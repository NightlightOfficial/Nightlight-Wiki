# Managing privacy
Feel at ease on Nightlight by using our privacy options

### Manage what others can see about you

While Nightlight is a social platform, we understand that you might feel more comfortable not sharing some things with others, that's why you have control over what others see.

#### Your activity

Here are some things on your profile which you can make public or completely private using the Privacy settings on Nightlight:

* **Posts you've liked** (By default visible only to mutuals)
* **Posts you've commented on** (By default visible only to mutuals)

Activity which is always **public**:

* People you follow and people that follow you
* The total amount of likes on all your posts
* Reposts

Activity which is always **private**:

* Notifications

#### Your info

All information about you on Nightlight is public, except for personal data (e.g. email, password, etc.)

<details>

    <summary>Public data</summary>

    * Display name and username
    * About me
    * Sexuality & Pronouns
    * Custom status
    * Level & XP
    * Badges
    * Any customization items
    * Registration date

### Manage who can interact with you

Nightlight should be a place where everyone feels comfortable being and posting on. That's why you are in control when it comes to managing who gets to interact with you.

#### Messages

Being able to message someone is great, but sometimes you want to limit certain things. By visiting the privacy settings on Nightlight, you can manage the following:

* Who can message you
* This does not affect existing conversations
* Who can send you media in messages
* Who can add you to group chats

You can either make the options above available to anyone or no one, you are in control.

#### Blocking

If a user is making you uncomfortable or you for any reason don't wish to interact with them anymore, you can [block](/docs/basics/blocking) them.
