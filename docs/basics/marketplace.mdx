Learn more about the Nightlight Marketplace - a place for you and other users to sell their item

### What is the Nightlight Marketplace?

Nightlight Marketplace is a place for users to sell and buy items made by other users! It's essentially a space for everyone to make cool stuff and be able to share it with others on the platform.

### How do I buy items?

There are currently two types of items on the Nightlight Marketplace:

* **Nightlight Originals**
* Items made by Nightlight officially. These items can either be exchanged for NCPs or purchased for money.
* **Community Items**
* Items made by the community. These items can only be exchanged for NCPs, the seller gets ½ of the item's price back and also ⅕ of required XP to level-up!

:::note

We are planning support for allowing everyone to sell their items for money

### How do I sell items?

You can publish your items through [Creator Hub](https://wiki.night-light.cz/basics/items-and-creators/creator-hub)

### Rarities

There are different rarities for items on the Marketplace. Each rarity has its own fixed price and all items get their rarity assigned by Nightlight depending on the item's features.&#x20;

### Collab banners

Marketplace often shows banners with items on top of the page. These items are either a featured category, or a collaboration with different artists. If you wish to collaborate with Nightlight, please contact us at support@night-light.cz or our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/UbQpRYRMkg)!
