# Verification
Reassurance about a user

### What does it do

Being verified doesn't give you any immediate benefits, nor is it made to be beneficial. Verification on Nightlight is here to fight impersonation.

When you're verified, it gives other users a reassurance that you are not an impersonator.

### How to get verified

The verification process is completely manual, for a good reason. We want to make sure people who are verified are not impersonators and are properly following the Terms of Service.

Requirements:

* Have an active connection with a Twitch and/or Discord accounts
* Go through an email verification process
* This process requires you to have an active email on another social media account like YouTube which we will attempt to contact to make sure it's you

To start with verification, contact the official [Nightlight](https://night-light.cz/u/nightlight) account and ask about verification.
