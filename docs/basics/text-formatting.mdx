# Text formatting
Text formatting allows you to bring more life and contrast to your posts, by allowing you to change text styles.

### Text? Formatting? Text formatting? I don't get it...

You may be confused about what text formatting even means, but trust us, it's a very neat feature! It allows you to make your text look **better** than just a *string that looks the same without any differences*.

#### Okay but how do I use it⁉️

Good question, and to make it short, here are some examples:

| Name          | Format | How to use it              | How it looks like                    |
|---------------|--------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Bold          | ****   | **I like cats**        | i like cats                          |
| Italic        | **     | *nighty is a cat*      | nighty is a cat                      |
| Strikethrough | ~~~~   | ~~praise nighty~~      | praise nighty                        |
